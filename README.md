# Eelco Wesemann - Platform & SRE Engineer

Hi, I’m Eelco (sgaduuw), a platform engineer / SRE based in the Netherlands. I build and run infrastructure using Terraform and the Elastic stack, with a focus on reliability, automation and clear observability.

- **Stack:** Terraform, Ansible, ELK, Python/Bash.
- **Interests:** IaC, CI/CD, platform operations, automation, monitoring, and sharing what works.
- **Blog:** [eng.eelcowesemann.nl](https://eng.eelcowesemann.nl) – posts on HAProxy, logging, Linux and more.

I prefer to let automation do the hard work and keep things simple and robust. If you share those values, feel free to reach out or fork anything useful.
