- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @sgaduuw
  Platform/SRE engineer focused on making infrastructure boringly reliable. I build and operate cloudâ€‘native stacks with Terraform, Ansible and the Elastic stack; automate everything; and care about observability, security and user experience. Expect blunt opinions, strong automation bias, and a drive to improve things for the teams I support.
