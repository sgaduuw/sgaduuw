- 👋 Hi, I’m @sgaduuw
  Please bear witness to me creating repos for ideas, and realizing I don't actually having the spare time to work them out, or push them to origin.
- 👀 I’m interested in: sleep.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning: restraint.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on: nothing currently.
- 📫 How to reach me: stand on a roof and yell loudly.
